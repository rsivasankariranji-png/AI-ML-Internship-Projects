Milk Demand Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts future milk demand for a dairy company using Machine Learning.

Problem:
Dairy companies lose money if they overproduce or underproduce milk.

Solution:
A Linear Regression model is trained using daily milk sales data to predict future demand.

Tools:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Use Case:
This model can help companies like Milky Mist plan production and reduce waste.
